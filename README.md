# 2.3_powers_multiplication_table
tells user squares and cubes as well as a multiplication table of entered integer
Here is my 2.3 powers table lab. I struggled most with the formatting for this one. 
From researching I know it's possible for me to have done better but at the moment the 
concepts I was finding were beyond me. Hopefully in the future I can learn more about thsoe 
techniques. For example my multiplication table formatting doesn't play well with large numbers. 
Anwyas the project was fun and taugh me a lot about for loops. If you have any questions feel 
free to reach out!
